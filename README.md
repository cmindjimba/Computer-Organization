Project Report on Virtual Reality

Virtual Reality has been around for 169 years. It is Charles Wheatsone who first described the perception of 3D images 
by binocular vision in 1838. He invented a stereoscopic viewing device that was used to view prepared images in 3D, 
that later became the famous toy the Viewmaster (Cummings)Â¬ The concept of virtual reality is creating a simulation of a 
three-dimensional world, using computer technology, that the user can explore and feel as if they were in that world (intro2). 
However, there are different kind of virtual environment that make the user feel more or less in a virtual world.
